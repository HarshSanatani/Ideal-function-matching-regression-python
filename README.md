# README for Function Matching using Supervised Learning  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on **identifying the most appropriate mathematical functions** that fit a given labeled dataset using supervised learning principles. It simulates pattern recognition and curve fitting by evaluating predefined candidate functions against training data, aiming to approximate the underlying function that generated the observations.  

## Objective  
- Determine which candidate function best represents the relationship between input-output pairs in the training data.  
- Calculate and compare errors between actual and predicted outputs.  
- Select the best-fitting function based on defined threshold criteria.  

## Applications  
- Model selection for regression tasks.  
- Pattern recognition in scientific or engineering data.  
- Foundational understanding of supervised learning without relying on high-level ML libraries.  

## Methodology  
1. **Data Ingestion**:  
   - Load training dataset (input-output pairs) and predefined candidate functions.  

2. **Function Matching**:  
   - Compute the **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)** between each candidate function and the training data.  

3. **Threshold-Based Selection**:  
   - Identify functions where the error falls within acceptable limits.  

4. **Visualization**:  
   - Plot training data alongside top-performing candidate functions for qualitative comparison.  

## Key Features  
âœ… **Error-Driven Selection**: Uses SSE to objectively rank candidate functions.  
âœ… **Transparent Process**: No black-box models; emphasizes manual computation for learning.  
âœ… **Visual Comparison**: Matplotlib plots to validate function fits.  
âœ… **Scalable Design**: Modular structure for adding new candidate functions or datasets.  

## Project Structure  
```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ data/            # Training data and candidate function datasets  
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/       # Jupyter notebooks for analysis  
â”œâ”€â”€ src/             # Python scripts (optional modular functions)  
â”œâ”€â”€ output/          # Graphs and result summaries  
â””â”€â”€ README.md  
```  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and error calculations.  
- **Pandas**: Data handling (if datasets are in tabular form).  
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization of data and function fits.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis and documentation.
