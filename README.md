# README for Bike Sharing Demand Prediction  

## Project Overview  
This project involves building a **multi-linear regression model** to predict bike rental demand based on environmental and seasonal factors. The analysis explores how features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and time-based variables influence bike-sharing usage patterns.  

## Objective  
- Develop a predictive model to forecast daily/hourly bike rental demand.  
- Identify key factors that significantly impact bike-sharing usage.  
- Provide actionable insights for optimizing bike availability, pricing, and promotions.  

## Dataset  
The dataset includes historical bike-sharing data with the following key features:  
- **Environmental factors**: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather conditions.  
- **Time-based variables**: Hour of the day, day of the week, season, holiday indicators.  
- **Target variable**: Number of bike rentals (demand).  

## Approach  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Analyzed trends, correlations, and distributions in the data.  
   - Visualized relationships between features and bike demand.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handled outliers and missing values.  
   - Scaled numerical features for model consistency.  
   - Encoded categorical variables.  

3. **Feature Selection**:  
   - Used statistical methods (p-values, Variance Inflation Factor - VIF) to retain significant predictors.  
   - Addressed multicollinearity to improve model robustness.  

4. **Model Development**:  
   - Built a multi-linear regression model using **scikit-learn**.  
   - Evaluated assumptions (linearity, homoscedasticity, normality of residuals).  

5. **Model Validation**:  
   - Split data into training and testing sets.  
   - Applied cross-validation to ensure generalizability.  
   - Assessed performance using **R² score, RMSE, and MAE**.  

6. **Interpretability**:  
   - Analyzed regression coefficients to explain feature impact on demand.  

## Key Findings  
✅ **Top Demand Drivers**:  
   - **Temperature**: Higher temperatures positively correlate with increased rentals.  
   - **Weather Conditions**: Clear days see significantly more rentals than rainy/snowy days.  
   - **Time-Based Trends**: Peak demand occurs during commuting hours (8 AM, 5 PM) and weekends.  

✅ **Model Performance**:  
   - Achieved a high **R² score** (explained variance) and low **RMSE/MAE**, indicating strong predictive accuracy.  
   - Residual analysis confirmed model assumptions were met.  

✅ **Business Insights**:  
   - **Optimal Bike Allocation**: Increase supply during warm, clear days and peak hours.  
   - **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjust pricing based on predicted high/low demand periods.  
   - **Promotions**: Target weekends and holidays to boost off-peak rentals.
